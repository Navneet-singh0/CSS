            <p> I found a love for me<br>
                darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
                Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
                Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
                'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
                Not knowing what it was<br>
                I will not give you up this time<br>
                But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
                And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br>
                
                Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
                Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song<br>
                When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
                But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
                
                Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
                She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
                I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
                To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
                We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
                Fighting against all odds<br>
                I know we'll be alright this time<br>
                Darling, just hold my hand<br>
                Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
                I see my future in your eyes</p>
